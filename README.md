# **BOOK REVIEW BACKEND APPLICATION USING NODE.JS AND EXPRESS**

This application is a book review system developed using a code template that I forked from the IBM skills network repository during my IBM Full Stack Software developer certification. The name of the course that this final project was made for is "Backend application development with Node.JS and Express".

In this final project, I have built a server-side online book review application and integrated it with a secure REST API server which will use authentication at session level using JWT.The application was tested using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.
